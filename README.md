# golang-crud
Simple CRUD made with Golang to learn the language. Project made following HunCoding playlist on YT.

## Step by step of what I did 

### Creating main.go and initiating go.mod file

First run `go mod init github.com/isnotvinicius/<project-name>` to create the `go.mod` file.

Then create the `main.go` and `.env` files on the root of the project. After creating the `.env` file, I've imported the `godotenv` library to be able to use the `.env` variables in my project

### Setting up the src folder

In order to organize the code, I created the `/src` folder in the root of the project which will contain all the MVC structure of the project along with the test and configuration modules.
